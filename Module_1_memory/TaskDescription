#Implement classes Array2d, DifferenceOperator, Writer and HeatEquation and solve the two dimensional heat equation 
with Dirichlet boundaries on all sides of the domain. You are free to choose the heat conductivity, domain dimensions and
node count as you please but make sure that you are able to visualize the mesh and the solution somehow.
