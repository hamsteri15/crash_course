#Here the task is to first generate a math library with objects 'vector' and 'matrix' that support math operations. 
For simplicity you can constrain the operations only to be vector against vector and matrix against matrix. 
In addition to that, scalar operations need to be defined for both of them i.e. matrix * matrix and matrix * scalar should 
be defined whereas matrix * vector does not.

#For every function you generate in the math library, make sure you write a corresponding unit test into the tests folder as you go.



#Folders:
lib/math   #math library source
src/       #applications that use the math library
tests/math #unittests for the math library !This folder is missing a CMakeLists.txt file that you need to create yourself.


#Compile lib/math/* into a _library_ called mathlib and write an application
